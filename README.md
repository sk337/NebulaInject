# Nebula

A really bad C++ Minecraft injection client for linux/Windows (windows support later). Some code (as of right now) is based on 
[Phantom](https://github.com/SomePineaple/Phantom)

# Building

You should be able to just run ./build.sh if not just use phantom's intruction's

# Deps

Java 8
CMake
Minecraft (obv)


# Usage

As of rn you can just use [Phantom's injector](https://github.com/SomePineaple/Phantom-Injector/). Although I am working on my own more "Modern" looking injector
